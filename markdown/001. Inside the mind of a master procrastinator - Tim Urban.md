|00:11|So in college, I was a ***government major*** [sinh viên chuyên ngành hành chính], which means I had to write ***a lot of papers*** [rất nhiều tiểu luận]. Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might ***spread the work out a little like this*** [phân chia công việc như thế này]. So, you know. |
|00:26|you ***get started maybe a little slowly*** [bắt đầu từ từ], but you get enough done in the first week that, ***with some heavier days later on*** [với thêm một chút mỗi ngày sau đó], everything gets done, ***things stay civil*** [mọi thứ đúng hẹn]. |
|00:35|And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would have it all ready to go, but then, actually, the paper would ***come along*** [xuất hiện], and then I would kind of do this. |
|00:48|And that would happen every single paper. |
|00:51|But then came my ***90-page senior thesis*** [luận văn cao cấp dài 90 trang], a paper you're supposed to spend a year on. And I knew for a paper like that, my normal ***work flow*** [quy trình làm việc] was not an option. It was way too big a project. So I ***planned things out*** [lên kế hoạch cho mọi thứ], and I decided I kind of had to go something like this. This is how the year would go. So I'd ***start off light*** [bắt đầu nhẹ nhàng], and I'd ***bump it up*** [tăng tốc lên] in the middle months, and then at the end, I would ***kick it up into high gear*** [chạy hết tốc lực] just like ***a little staircase*** [những chiếc bậc thang nhỏ]. How hard could it be to walk up the stairs? ***No big deal, right*** [không có gì to tát, phải không] ? |
|01:22|But then, ***the funniest thing happened*** [điều hài hước nhất]. Those first few months? They came and went, and ***I couldn't quite do stuff*** [tôi đã không thể làm gì]. So we had ***an awesome new revised plan*** [một kế hoạch mới được điều chỉnh khá đáng sợ]. |
|01:32|And then...|
|01:35|But then those middle months actually ***went by*** [trôi qua], and I didn't really write words, and so we were here. And then two months ***turned into*** [biến thành] one month, which turned into two weeks. And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word, and so I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, ***pulling not one but two all-nighters*** [thức trắng không chỉ một mà là hai đêm], ***humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters*** [con người không được sinh ra để thức hai đêm liền], ***sprinted across campus*** [chạy nước rút qua lại trong khuôn viên trường], ***dove in slow motion*** [đuối dần dần], and got it in just at the deadline. |
|02:11|I thought that was the end of everything. But a week later I get a call, and it's the school. And they say, "Is this Tim Urban?" And I say, "Yeah." And they say, "We need to talk about your thesis." And I say, "OK." And they say, "It's the best one we've ever seen." |
|02:36|That did not happen. |
|02:39|It was a very, very bad thesis. |
|02:44|I just wanted to ***enjoy*** [được hưởng thụ] that one moment when all of you thought, "This guy is amazing!" |
|02:52|No, no, it was very, very bad. Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy. I write the blog Wait But Why. And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination. My ***behavior*** [thái độ] has always ***perplexed*** [làm lúng túng] the non-procrastinators around me, and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world ***what goes on in the heads*** [chuyện gì đang xảy ra trong đầu] of procrastinators, and ***why we are the way we are*** [tại sao chúng ta lại như vậy]. Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people. And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator, so I could compare them. I actually brought them here to show you today. I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference. I know that if you're not ***a trained brain expert*** [một chuyên gia não bộ được đào tạo], ***it's not that obvious*** [nó không quá rõ ràng], but just take a look, OK? So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator. |
|03:45|Now ... here's my brain. |
|03:55|There is a difference. Both brains have a ***Rational Decision-Maker*** [người đưa ra quyết định hợp lí] in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has ***an Instant Gratification Monkey*** [một con khỉ hài lòng tức thì]. Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator? Well, it means everything's fine until this happens. |
|04:11|So the Rational Decision-Maker will ***make the rational decision*** [đưa ra một quyết định hợp lí] to do something ***productive*** [có hiệu quả], but the Monkey doesn't like that plan, so he actually ***takes the wheel*** [cầm lấy tay lái], and he says, "Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan/ Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that that happened. |
