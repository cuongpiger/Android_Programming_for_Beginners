|00:11|So in college, I was a ***government major*** <span class="vn">[sinh viên chuyên ngành hành chính]</span>, which means I had to write ***a lot of papers*** <span class="vn">[rất nhiều tiểu luận]</span>. Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might ***spread the work out a little like this*** <span class="vn">[phân chia công việc như thế này]</span>. So, you know. |
|00:26|you ***get started maybe a little slowly*** <span class="vn">[bắt đầu từ từ]</span>, but you get enough done in the first week that, ***with some heavier days later on*** <span class="vn">[với thêm một chút mỗi ngày sau đó]</span>, everything gets done, ***things stay civil*** <span class="vn">[mọi thứ đúng hẹn]</span>. |
|00:35|And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would have it all ready to go, but then, actually, the paper would ***come along*** <span class="vn">[xuất hiện]</span>, and then I would kind of do this. |
|00:48|And that would happen every single paper. |
|00:51|But then came my ***90-page senior thesis*** <span class="vn">[luận văn cao cấp dài 90 trang]</span>, a paper you're supposed to spend a year on. And I knew for a paper like that, my normal ***work flow*** <span class="vn">[quy trình làm việc]</span> was not an option. It was way too big a project. So I ***planned things out*** <span class="vn">[lên kế hoạch cho mọi thứ]</span>, and I decided I kind of had to go something like this. This is how the year would go. So I'd ***start off light*** <span class="vn">[bắt đầu nhẹ nhàng]</span>, and I'd ***bump it up*** <span class="vn">[tăng tốc lên]</span> in the middle months, and then at the end, I would ***kick it up into high gear*** <span class="vn">[chạy hết tốc lực]</span> just like ***a little staircase*** <span class="vn">[những chiếc bậc thang nhỏ]</span>. How hard could it be to walk up the stairs? ***No big deal, right*** <span class="vn">[không có gì to tát, phải không]</span> ? |
|01:22|But then, ***the funniest thing happened*** <span class="vn">[điều hài hước nhất]</span>. Those first few months? They came and went, and ***I couldn't quite do stuff*** <span class="vn">[tôi đã không thể làm gì]</span>. So we had ***an awesome new revised plan*** <span class="vn">[một kế hoạch mới được điều chỉnh khá đáng sợ]</span>. |
|01:32|And then...|
|01:35|But then those middle months actually ***went by*** <span class="vn">[trôi qua]</span>, and I didn't really write words, and so we were here. And then two months ***turned into*** <span class="vn">[biến thành]</span> one month, which turned into two weeks. And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word, and so I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, ***pulling not one but two all-nighters*** <span class="vn">[thức trắng không chỉ một mà là hai đêm]</span>, ***humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters*** <span class="vn">[con người không được sinh ra để thức hai đêm liền]</span>, ***sprinted across campus*** <span class="vn">[chạy nước rút qua lại trong khuôn viên trường]</span>, ***dove in slow motion*** <span class="vn">[đuối dần dần]</span>, and got it in just at the deadline. |
|02:11|I thought that was the end of everything. But a week later I get a call, and it's the school. And they say, "Is this Tim Urban?" And I say, "Yeah." And they say, "We need to talk about your thesis." And I say, "OK." And they say, "It's the best one we've ever seen." |
|02:36|That did not happen. |
|02:39|It was a very, very bad thesis. |
|02:44|I just wanted to ***enjoy*** <span class="vn">[được hưởng thụ]</span> that one moment when all of you thought, "This guy is amazing!" |
|02:52|No, no, it was very, very bad. Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy. I write the blog Wait But Why. And a ***couple of years ago*** <span class="vn">[vài năm trước]</span>, I decided to write about procrastination. My ***behavior*** <span class="vn">[thái độ]</span> has always ***perplexed*** <span class="vn">[làm lúng túng]</span> the non-procrastinators around me, and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world ***what goes on in the heads*** <span class="vn">[chuyện gì đang xảy ra trong đầu]</span> of procrastinators, and ***why we are the way we are*** <span class="vn">[tại sao chúng ta lại như vậy]</span>. Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people. And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator, so I could compare them. I actually brought them here to show you today. I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference. I know that if you're not ***a trained brain expert*** <span class="vn">[một chuyên gia não bộ được đào tạo]</span>, ***it's not that obvious*** <span class="vn">[nó không quá rõ ràng]</span>, but just take a look, OK? So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator. |
|03:45|Now ... here's my brain. |
|03:55|There is a difference. Both brains have a ***Rational Decision-Maker*** <span class="vn">[người đưa ra quyết định hợp lí]</span> in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has ***an Instant Gratification Monkey*** <span class="vn">[một con khỉ hài lòng tức thì]</span>. Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator? Well, it means everything's fine until this happens. |
|04:11|So the Rational Decision-Maker will ***make the rational decision*** <span class="vn">[đưa ra một quyết định hợp lí]</span> to do something ***productive*** <span class="vn">[có hiệu quả]</span>, but the Monkey doesn't like that plan, so he actually ***takes the wheel*** <span class="vn">[cầm lấy tay lái]</span>, and he says, "Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan/ Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that that happened. |
||Then -- |
||Then we're going to ***go over to*** <span class="vn">[kiểm tra]</span> the fridge, to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago. After that, we're going to ***go on a YouTube spiral*** <span class="vn">[đi lên vòng xoáy YouTube]</span> that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about ***magnets*** and ends much, much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom. |
||"All of that's going to ***take a while*** <span class="vn">[tốn một ít thời gian]</span>, so we're not going to really ***have room on the schedule*** <span class="vn">[có chổ trong thời gian biểu]</span> for any work today. Sorry!" |
||Now, what is going on here? The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel. He lives entirely in the present moment. He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things: easy and fun. |
||Now, in the animal world, that works fine. If you're a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things, you're a huge success! |
||And to the Monkey, humans are just another animal species. You have to keep ***well-slept*** <span class="vn">[giấc ngủ ngon]</span>, ***well-fed*** <span class="vn">[ăn uống đầy đủ]</span> and ***propagating into the next generation*** <span class="vn">[duy trì nòi giống cho thế hệ tiếp theo]</span>, which in ***tribal times*** <span class="vn">[thời kì nguyên thủy]</span> might have worked OK. But, if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times. We're in ***an advanced civilization*** <span class="vn">[một nền văn minh tiến bộ]</span>, and the Monkey does not know what that is. Which is why we have another guy in our brain, the Rational Decision-Maker, who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do. We can ***visualize*** <span class="vn">[hình dung]</span> the future. We can see the big picture. We can ***make long-term plans*** <span class="vn">[lập các kế hoạch dài hạn]</span>. And he wants to ***take all of that into account*** <span class="vn">[tính đến tất cả các điều đó]</span>. And he wants to just have us do whatever ***makes sense*** <span class="vn">[có ý nghĩa]</span> to be doing right now. Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner or going to bed or ***enjoying well-earned leisure time*** <span class="vn">[tận hưởng thời gian nhàn rỗi xứng đáng]</span>. That's why there's an overlap. Sometimes they agree. ***But other times*** <span class="vn">[nhưng có những lúc]</span>, it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and ***less pleasant*** <span class="vn">[ít vui vẻ hơn]</span>, for the ***sake*** <span class="vn">[lợi ích]</span> of the big picture. And that's when we have a ***conflict*** <span class="vn">[sự mâu thuẫn]</span>. And for the procrastinator, that conflict ***tends to end a certain way every time*** <span class="vn">[có xu hướng luôn chắc chắn]</span>, leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place that's ***entirely out of*** <span class="vn">[hoàn toàn nằm ngoài]</span> the Makes Sense circle. I call it the Dark ***Playground*** <span class="vn">[sân chơi]</span>. |
||Now, the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well. It's where ***leisure activities*** <span class="vn">[các hoạt động nhàn rỗi]</span> happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening. The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun, because it's ***completely unearned*** <span class="vn">[không cố gắng cũng có được]</span>, and the air is filled with ***guilt*** <span class="vn">[tội lỗi]</span>, ***dread*** <span class="vn">[sợ hãi]</span>, ***anxiety*** <span class="vn">[lo lắng]</span>, ***self-hatred*** <span class="vn">[mặc cảm]</span> - all of those good procrastinator feelings. And the question is, in this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel, how does the procrastinator ever ***get himself over here to this blue zone*** <span class="vn">[đưa anh ta vượt qua đây để đến vùng xanh này]</span>, a less pleasant place, but where really important things happen? |
||Well, ***turns out*** <span class="vn">[hóa ra]</span> the procrastinator has a ***guardian angel*** <span class="vn">[thiên thần hộ mệnh]</span>, someone who's always ***looking down on him*** <span class="vn">[khinh thường anh ta]</span> and ***watching over*** <span class="vn">[canh chừng]</span> him in his ***darkest moments*** <span class="vn">[những thời khắc đen tối nhất]</span> - someone called the ***Panic*** <span class="vn">[hốt hoảng]</span> Monster. |
||Now, the Panic Monster ***is dormant most of the time*** <span class="vn">[ngủ suốt]</span>, but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline ***gets too close*** <span class="vn">[đến quá gần]</span> or there's ***danger*** <span class="vn">[nguy cơ]</span> of public ***embarrassment*** <span class="vn">[sự bẽ mặt]</span>, a career disaster or ***some other scary consequence*** <span class="vn">[một vài hậu quả đáng sợ khác]</span>. And importantly, he's the only thing the Monkey is ***terrified of*** <span class="vn">[khiếp sợ]</span>. Now, he became very ***relevant*** <span class="vn">[có liên quan]</span> in my life ***pretty recently*** <span class="vn">[khá gần đây]</span>, because the people of TED ***reached out to me*** <span class="vn">[liên hệ đến tôi]</span> about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk. |
||Now, of course, I said yes. It's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past. |
||But in the middle of all this ***excitement*** <span class="vn">[sự phấn khích]</span>, the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his ***mind*** <span class="vn">[trí óc]</span>. He was saying, "Are we ***clear on*** <span class="vn">[hiểu rõ]</span> what we just accepted? ***Do we get*** <span class="vn">[chúng ta có hiểu]</span> what's going to be now happening one day in the future? We need to sit down and work on this right now." And the Monkey said, "***Totally agree*** <span class="vn">[hoàn toàn đồng ý]</span>, but let's just open Google Earth and ***zoom in*** <span class="vn">[phóng to]</span> to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground, and ***scroll up*** <span class="vn">[cuộn lên]</span> for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country, so we can get a better feel for India." |
||So that's what we did that day. |
||As six months ***turned into*** <span class="vn">[chuyển thành]</span> four and then two and then one, the people of TED decided to ***release*** <span class="vn">[giới thiệu]</span> the speakers. And I opened up the website, and there was my face ***staring right back at me*** <span class="vn">[đang nhìn chằm chằm vào tôi]</span>. And guess who woke up? |
||So the Panic Monster starts ***losing his mind*** <span class="vn">[mất trí]</span>, and a few seconds later, the whole system's ***in mayhem*** <span class="vn">[rơi vào tình trạng hỗn loạn]</span>. |
||And the Monkey - remember, he's terrified of the Panic Monster -- boom, he's up the tree! And finally, finally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk. |
||Now, the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty ***insane*** <span class="vn">[điên rồ]</span> procrastinator behavior, like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper, and then ***miraculously*** <span class="vn">[kì diệu]</span> find the unbelievable ***work ethic*** <span class="vn">[đạo lí làm việc]</span> to ***stay up all night*** <span class="vn">[thức suốt đêm]</span> and write eight pages. And this entire situation, with the three characters -- this is the procrastinator's system. ***It's not pretty*** <span class="vn">[nó không hay ho gì]</span>, but in the end, it works. This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago. |
||When I did, I was amazed by the ***response*** <span class="vn">[sự phản hồi]</span>. ***Literally*** <span class="vn">[thật vậy]</span> thousands of emails ***came in*** <span class="vn">[gửi đến]</span>, from all different kinds of people from all over the world, doing all different kinds of ***things*** <span class="vn">[hoàn cảnh]</span>. These are people who were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers and lots and lots of PhD students. |
||And they were all writing, saying the same thing: "I have this problem too." But ***what struck me*** <span class="vn">[điều gây ấn tượng với tôi]</span> was the ***contrast*** <span class="vn">[sự tương phản/trái ngược]</span> between ***the light tone of the post*** <span class="vn">[bài viết có giọng điệu nhẹ nhàng]</span> and the heaviness of these emails. These people were writing with ***intense frustration*** <span class="vn">[sự thất vọng tột độ]</span> about what procrastination had done to their lives, about what this Monkey had done to them. And I thought about this, and I said, well, if the procrastinator's system works, then what's going on? Why are all of these people in such a dark place? |
||Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination. Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given, they all have deadlines. And when there's deadlines, the ***effects*** <span class="vn">[những tác động]</span> of procrastination are ***contained to the short term*** <span class="vn">[nén lại trong thời hạn ngắn]</span> because the Panic Monster ***gets involved*** <span class="vn">[bị cuống vào]</span>. But there's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline. So if you wanted a career where you're a ***self-starter*** <span class="vn">[người tự khởi xướng]</span> - something in the arts, something ***entrepreneurial*** <span class="vn">[khởi nghiệp]</span> - there's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening, not until you've ***gone out and done the hard work*** <span class="vn">[lao đầu vào công việc]</span> to ***get momentum*** <span class="vn">[lấy đà]</span>, ***get things going*** <span class="vn">[giúp mọi thứ diễn ra]</span>. There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don't involve any deadlines, like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health, working on your relationship or ***getting out of a relationship*** <span class="vn">[chấm dứt một mối quan hệ]</span> that ***isn't working*** <span class="vn">[đang không ổn]</span>. |
||Now if the procrastinator's only ***mechanism*** <span class="vn">[cơ chế]</span> of doing these hard things is the Panic Monster, that's a problem, because in all of these non-deadline situations, the Panic Monster doesn't ***show up*** <span class="vn">[xuất hiện]</span>. He has nothing to wake up for, so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained; they just ***extend outward*** <span class="vn">[mở rộng ra ngoài]</span> forever. And it's this long-term kind of procrastination that's much ***less visible*** <span class="vn">[ít được nhìn thấy]</span> and much less talked about than the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind. It's usually ***suffered*** <span class="vn">[trải qua]</span> quietly and privately. And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and ***regrets*** <span class="vn">[nổi ân hận]</span>. And I thought, that's why those people are emailing, and that's why they're in such a bad place. It's not that they're ***cramming*** <span class="vn">[nhồi nhét]</span> for some project. It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a ***spectator*** <span class="vn">[khán giả]</span>, at times, in their own lives. The frustration is not that they couldn't ***achieve*** <span class="vn">[đạt được]</span> their dreams; it's that they weren't even able to start ***chasing*** <span class="vn">[săn đuổi]</span> them. |
||So I read these emails and ***I had a little bit of an epiphany*** <span class="vn">[tôi đã thoáng thấy]</span> - that I don't think non-procrastinators exist. That's right - I think all of you are procrastinators. Now, you might not all be ***a mess*** <span class="vn">[tình trạng lộn xộn]</span>, like some of us, |
||and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines, but remember: the Monkey's ***sneakiest trick*** <span class="vn">[mánh khóe lén lún]</span> is when the deadlines aren't there. |
||Now, I want to show you one last thing. I call this a Life Calendar. That's one box for every week of a 90-year life. That's not that many boxes, especially since we've already used a bunch of those. So I think we need to ***all take a long, hard look at*** <span class="vn">[xem xét kĩ lưỡng]</span> that calendar. We need to think about what we're really ***procrastinating on*** <span class="vn">[trì hoãn thứ gì đó]</span>, because everyone is procrastinating on something in life. We need to ***stay aware of*** <span class="vn">[lưu ý về]</span> the Instant Gratification Monkey. That's a job for all of us. And because there's not that many boxes on there, it's a job that should probably start today.|
||Well, maybe not today, but ... |
||You know. Sometime soon. |
||Thank you|
