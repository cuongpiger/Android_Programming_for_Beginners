|00:11|So in college, I was a ***government major*** [sinh viên chuyên ngành hành chính], which means I had to write ***a lot of papers*** [rất nhiều tiểu luận]. Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might ***spread the work out a little like this*** [phân chia công việc như thế này]. So, you know. |
|00:26|you ***get started maybe a little slowly*** [bắt đầu từ từ], but you get enough done in the first week that, ***with some heavier days later on*** [với thêm một chút mỗi ngày sau đó], everything gets done, ***things stay civil*** [mọi thứ đúng hẹn]. |
|00:35|And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would have it all ready to go, but then, actually, the paper would ***come along*** [xuất hiện], and then I would kind of do this. |
|00:48|And that would happen every single paper. |
|00:51|But then came my ***90-page senior thesis*** [luận văn cao cấp dài 90 trang], a paper you're supposed to spend a year on. And I knew for a paper like that, my normal ***work flow*** [quy trình làm việc] was not an option. It was way too big a project. So I ***planned things out*** [lên kế hoạch cho mọi thứ], and I decided I kind of had to go something like this. This is how the year would go. So I'd ***start off light*** [bắt đầu nhẹ nhàng], and I'd ***bump it up*** [tăng tốc lên] in the middle months, and then at the end, I would ***kick it up into high gear*** [chạy hết tốc lực] just like ***a little staircase*** [những chiếc bậc thang nhỏ]. How hard could it be to walk up the stairs? ***No big deal, right*** [không có gì to tát, phải không] ? |
|01:22|But then, ***the funniest thing happened*** [điều hài hước nhất]. Those first few months? They came and went, and ***I couldn't quite do stuff*** [tôi đã không thể làm gì]. So we had ***an awesome new revised plan*** [một kế hoạch mới được điều chỉnh khá đáng sợ]. |
|01:32|And then...|
|01:35|But then those middle months actually ***went by*** [trôi qua], and I didn't really write words, and so we were here. And then two months ***turned into*** [biến thành] one month, which turned into two weeks. And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word, and so I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, ***pulling not one but two all-nighters*** [thức trắng không chỉ một mà là hai đêm], ***humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters*** [con người không được sinh ra để thức hai đêm liền], ***sprinted across campus*** [chạy nước rút qua lại trong khuôn viên trường], ***dove in slow motion*** [đuối dần dần], and got it in just at the deadline. |
|02:11|I thought that was the end of everything. But a week later I get a call, and it's the school. And they say, "Is this Tim Urban?" And I say, "Yeah." And they say, "We need to talk about your thesis." And I say, "OK." And they say, "It's the best one we've ever seen." |
|02:36|That did not happen. |
|02:39|It was a very, very bad thesis. |
|02:44|I just wanted to ***enjoy*** [được hưởng thụ] that one moment when all of you thought, "This guy is amazing!" |
|02:52|No, no, it was very, very bad. Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy. I write the blog Wait But Why. And a ***couple of years ago*** [vài năm trước], I decided to write about procrastination. My ***behavior*** [thái độ] has always ***perplexed*** [làm lúng túng] the non-procrastinators around me, and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world ***what goes on in the heads*** [chuyện gì đang xảy ra trong đầu] of procrastinators, and ***why we are the way we are*** [tại sao chúng ta lại như vậy]. Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people. And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator, so I could compare them. I actually brought them here to show you today. I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference. I know that if you're not ***a trained brain expert*** [một chuyên gia não bộ được đào tạo], ***it's not that obvious*** [nó không quá rõ ràng], but just take a look, OK? So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator. |
|03:45|Now ... here's my brain. |
|03:55|There is a difference. Both brains have a ***Rational Decision-Maker*** [người đưa ra quyết định hợp lí] in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has ***an Instant Gratification Monkey*** [một con khỉ hài lòng tức thì]. Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator? Well, it means everything's fine until this happens. |
|04:11|So the Rational Decision-Maker will ***make the rational decision*** [đưa ra một quyết định hợp lí] to do something ***productive*** [có hiệu quả], but the Monkey doesn't like that plan, so he actually ***takes the wheel*** [cầm lấy tay lái], and he says, "Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan/ Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that that happened. |
||Then -- |
||Then we're going to ***go over to*** [kiểm tra] the fridge, to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago. After that, we're going to ***go on a YouTube spiral*** [đi lên vòng xoáy YouTube] that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about ***magnets*** and ends much, much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom. |
||"All of that's going to ***take a while*** [tốn một ít thời gian], so we're not going to really ***have room on the schedule*** [có chổ trong thời gian biểu] for any work today. Sorry!" |
||Now, what is going on here? The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel. He lives entirely in the present moment. He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things: easy and fun. |
||Now, in the animal world, that works fine. If you're a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things, you're a huge success! |
||And to the Monkey, humans are just another animal species. You have to keep ***well-slept*** [giấc ngủ ngon], ***well-fed*** [ăn uống đầy đủ] and ***propagating into the next generation*** [duy trì nòi giống cho thế hệ tiếp theo], which in ***tribal times*** [thời kì nguyên thủy] might have worked OK. But, if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times. We're in ***an advanced civilization*** [một nền văn minh tiến bộ], and the Monkey does not know what that is. Which is why we have another guy in our brain, the Rational Decision-Maker, who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do. We can ***visualize*** [hình dung] the future. We can see the big picture. We can ***make long-term plans*** [lập các kế hoạch dài hạn]. And he wants to ***take all of that into account*** [tính đến tất cả các điều đó]. And he wants to just have us do whatever ***makes sense*** [có ý nghĩa] to be doing right now. Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner or going to bed or ***enjoying well-earned leisure time*** [tận hưởng thời gian nhàn rỗi xứng đáng]. That's why there's an overlap. Sometimes they agree. ***But other times*** [nhưng có những lúc], it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and ***less pleasant*** [ít vui vẻ hơn], for the ***sake*** [lợi ích] of the big picture. And that's when we have a ***conflict*** [sự mâu thuẫn]. And for the procrastinator, that conflict ***tends to end a certain way every time*** [có xu hướng luôn chắc chắn], leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place that's ***entirely out of*** [hoàn toàn nằm ngoài] the Makes Sense circle. I call it the Dark ***Playground*** [sân chơi]. |
||Now, the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well. It's where ***leisure activities*** [các hoạt động nhàn rỗi] happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening. The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun, because it's ***completely unearned*** [không cố gắng cũng có được], and the air is filled with ***guilt*** [tội lỗi], ***dread*** [sợ hãi], ***anxiety*** [lo lắng], ***self-hatred*** [mặc cảm] - all of those good procrastinator feelings. And the question is, in this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel, how does the procrastinator ever ***get himself over here to this blue zone*** [đưa anh ta vượt qua đây để đến vùng xanh này], a less pleasant place, but where really important things happen? |
||Well, ***turns out*** [hóa ra] the procrastinator has a ***guardian angel*** [thiên thần hộ mệnh], someone who's always ***looking down on him*** [khinh thường anh ta] and ***watching over*** [canh chừng] him in his ***darkest moments*** [những thời khắc đen tối nhất] - someone called the ***Panic*** [hốt hoảng] Monster. |
||Now, the Panic Monster ***is dormant most of the time*** [ngủ suốt], but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline ***gets too close*** [đến quá gần] or there's ***danger*** [nguy cơ] of public ***embarrassment*** [sự bẽ mặt], a career disaster or ***some other scary consequence*** [một vài hậu quả đáng sợ khác]. And importantly, he's the only thing the Monkey is ***terrified of*** [khiếp sợ]. Now, he became very ***relevant*** [có liên quan] in my life ***pretty recently*** [khá gần đây], because the people of TED ***reached out to me*** [liên hệ đến tôi] about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk. |
||Now, of course, I said yes. It's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past. |
||But in the middle of all this ***excitement*** [sự phấn khích], the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his ***mind*** [trí óc]. He was saying, "Are we ***clear on*** [hiểu rõ] what we just accepted? ***Do we get*** [chúng ta có hiểu] what's going to be now happening one day in the future? We need to sit down and work on this right now." And the Monkey said, "***Totally agree*** [hoàn toàn đồng ý], but let's just open Google Earth and ***zoom in*** [phóng to] to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground, and ***scroll up*** [cuộn lên] for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country, so we can get a better feel for India." |
||So that's what we did that day. |
||As six months ***turned into*** [chuyển thành] four and then two and then one, the people of TED decided to ***release*** [giới thiệu] the speakers. And I opened up the website, and there was my face ***staring right back at me*** [đang nhìn chằm chằm vào tôi]. And guess who woke up? |
||So the Panic Monster starts ***losing his mind*** [mất trí], and a few seconds later, the whole system's ***in mayhem*** [rơi vào tình trạng hỗn loạn]. |
||And the Monkey - remember, he's terrified of the Panic Monster -- boom, he's up the tree! And finally, finally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk. |
||Now, the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty ***insane*** [điên rồ] procrastinator behavior, like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper, and then ***miraculously*** [kì diệu] find the unbelievable ***work ethic*** [đạo lí làm việc] to ***stay up all night*** [thức suốt đêm] and write eight pages. And this entire situation, with the three characters -- this is the procrastinator's system. ***It's not pretty*** [nó không hay ho gì], but in the end, it works. This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago. |
