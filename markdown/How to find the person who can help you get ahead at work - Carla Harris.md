|00:04|It was the spring of 1988 when I had ***the aha moment*** [khoảnh khắc tuyệt vời]. I was at my first ***roundtable*** [cuộc họp bàn tròn], and for those of you who don't know, the roundtable was ***a very commonly used phrase*** [một cụm từ được dùng rất phổ biến] on Wall Street to describe the year-end evaluative process for analysts, associates, vice presidents, all the way up to managing directors. That was the process where they were discussed behind closed doors around a table, i.e. the round table, and everyone was put into a category -- the top bucket, the middle bucket, the lower bucket -- and then that was translated into a bonus range that would be assigned to each professional. This was my first time there, and as I observed, I saw that there was one person that was responsible for recording the outcome of a conversation. There were other people in the room that had the responsibility of presenting the cases of all the candidates. And there were other invited guests who were supposed to comment as a candidate's position was presented. It was interesting to me that those other people were folks who were more senior than the folks that were being discussed and they theoretically had had some interaction with those candidates.|
